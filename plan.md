## Known Deferrals Within Completed Phases

- Product publish to WooCommerce currently returns a validated payload preview (HTTP 202, `dispatched: false`); actual delivery to WooCommerce is deferred to Phase 6.
- CSV/Excel import and product image upload are not yet implemented (planned within the Products Module track). AI product description is deferred to Phase 12.5 (AI Assistants).
- The live connect/verify handshake against a production WordPress + WooCommerce store will be exercised in Phase 6.

# Phase 3 — Auth, Tenants, Roles & Permissions ✅ COMPLETED

## Goal

## Core Concept

Each store is a tenant.

```txt
Store = Tenant
User can belong to one or more stores
Each user has a role per store
Each role has permissions
```

## Database Tables

```txt
users
stores
store_users
roles
permissions
role_permissions
user_roles
refresh_tokens
```

## Default Roles

```txt
Owner
Manager
Product Manager
Order Employee
Customer Support
Marketer
Accountant
Viewer
```

## Permissions

```txt
dashboard.view
products.view
products.create
products.edit
products.delete
orders.view
orders.edit
customers.view
team.view
team.create
team.edit
team.delete
automations.view
automations.edit
settings.view
settings.edit
```

## Backend Endpoints

```txt
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/logout
POST /auth/refresh
POST /auth/forgot-password
POST /auth/reset-password
GET  /auth/me

GET  /stores/current
POST /stores
PATCH /stores/:id

GET    /roles
POST   /roles
PATCH  /roles/:id
DELETE /roles/:id

DELETE /team/:id
```

## Frontend Tasks

- Connect login/register pages to API.
- Store auth token securely.
- Add protected routes.
- Add permission guard component.
- Build team page.
- Build roles page.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Store owner can register.
- Store is created for owner.
- Owner role is assigned automatically.
- Login works.
- Protected routes work.
- Permissions can block UI actions.
- Team and roles pages are functional.

---

# Phase 4 — WordPress Connector Plugin Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

## Goal

Build a lightweight WordPress plugin that connects a WooCommerce store to the SaaS dashboard.

## Plugin Responsibilities

- Show connection status inside WordPress admin.
- Store SaaS API URL and API key.
- Verify connection with SaaS backend.
- Expose health endpoint.
- Prepare WooCommerce data sync.

## Plugin Admin Page

Create admin page:

```txt
SaaS Connector
```

Fields:

```txt
SaaS API URL
API Key
Connection Status
Connect Button
Disconnect Button
Manual Sync Button
Last Sync Time
```

## Plugin REST Endpoints

```txt
GET  /wp-json/saas/v1/health
POST /wp-json/saas/v1/connect
POST /wp-json/saas/v1/disconnect
POST /wp-json/saas/v1/sync
```

## Backend Endpoints

```txt
POST /wp/connect
POST /wp/verify
POST /wp/disconnect
GET  /stores/:id/connection-status
```

## Security Requirements

- Use API key authentication.
- Never expose raw API key after saving.
- Verify requests from WordPress.
- Verify requests from SaaS to WordPress.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Plugin can be installed in WordPress.
- Plugin admin page exists.
- Store can be connected to SaaS.
- SaaS dashboard shows connection status.
- Health check works from both sides.

---

# Phase 4.5 — Dashboard Auth Integration & API Client ✅ COMPLETED

## Goal

Connect the React dashboard to the real backend auth system from Phase 3, replacing UI-only auth with live API calls, token persistence, and protected routing. This was the glue that made the dashboard real instead of mocked.

## Implemented

- Shared HTTP client (`apiRequest`) that unwraps the success/error envelope.
- Automatic 401 handling: deduped refresh-token call, retry-once, then forced logout.
- Access/refresh token persistence in localStorage (`saas.accessToken`, `saas.refreshToken`).
- `AuthProvider` context and `ProtectedRoute` guard.
- Login and Register pages wired to the real backend.
- Topbar wired to the authenticated user and logout.

## Backend Touchpoints

```txt
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/refresh
GET  /auth/me
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Login and register work against the real backend.
- Tokens persist across page reloads.
- Expired access tokens are refreshed transparently.
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users.

---

# Phase 5 — Products Module ✅ COMPLETED

## Goal

Allow store users to view, create, edit, archive, and publish products from the SaaS dashboard. Implemented **before** WooCommerce Sync so the dashboard has a working product surface and a publish foundation ahead of bulk import.

This phase shipped in two parts: **5.1 (foundation)** and **5.2 (hardening)**.

## Frontend Pages

```txt
/products
/products/new
/products/:id
/products/:id/edit
```

## Backend Endpoints

```txt
GET    /products             ✅ list (search / filter / pagination)
GET    /products/:id         ✅ details
POST   /products             ✅ create
PATCH  /products/:id         ✅ update
DELETE /products/:id         ✅ archive (soft delete)
POST   /products/:id/publish 🟡 publish foundation (payload preview, delivery deferred to Phase 6)
POST   /wp/products/sync     ✅ connector-authenticated upsert from WordPress
```

---

## Phase 5.1 — Products Module Foundation ✅ COMPLETED

### Implemented

- Drizzle `products` schema + migration (0002), store-scoped.
- Products module: service, controller, routes, Zod schemas, serializer (with unit tests).
- Full CRUD with RBAC permissions (`products.view` / `create` / `edit` / `delete`).
- Soft-delete (archive) instead of hard delete.
- Dashboard pages: list (search/filter/pagination), create, details, edit, and a shared `ProductForm`.
- `products-api.ts` client wired through `apiRequest`.
- WordPress plugin product class (`class-saas-connector-products.php`) for create/sync hooks.
- Publish foundation: validates and returns the WooCommerce payload preview (HTTP 202, `dispatched: false`). Actual delivery to WooCommerce is deferred to Phase 6.

### Pending

- CSV/Excel import (`POST /products/import`) — planned within the Products track.
- Product image upload — planned within the Products track.
- Real publish delivery to WooCommerce + returned WooCommerce product ID — lands in Phase 6.
- AI product description (`POST /products/ai-description`) — **deferred to Phase 12.5 (AI Assistants)**; intentionally kept out of the immediate Phase 6/7/8 path.

### BullMQ Jobs (planned)

```txt
publish_product_to_wp
import_products
```

---

## Phase 5.2 — Hardening: Real Connection Backend + Auth Rate Limiting ✅ COMPLETED

### Implemented

- Connection UI wired to the real backend (simulation removed):
  - `GET /wp/connection-status` (JWT) — status shown in the dashboard.
  - `POST /stores/current/api-key` (JWT) — generate / reveal one-time API key.
  - `POST /stores/current/disconnect` (JWT) — new disconnect endpoint.
- Connect/verify remain connector-key authenticated (driven by the WordPress plugin).
- Auth rate limiting (Redis fixed-window, fail-open) on `POST /auth/login`, `/auth/register`, and `/auth/refresh`, returning `RATE_LIMITED` (429) with `Retry-After`.
- Rate-limit window / max / enabled configurable via env (`AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_*`).

### Acceptance Criteria

- Connection status loads from the real backend and persists after refresh. ✅
- Generated API key is stored in the database (verified) and shown once in the UI. ✅
- Disconnect updates the connection status. ✅
- Exceeding the auth limit returns 429 `RATE_LIMITED`; valid logins still succeed. ✅
