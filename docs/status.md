**Headline (original audit):** The belief that work is "complete through Phase 20" held for the **backend** but not the **frontend** — Phases 17–20 had production-grade backends but no operator UIs. **Phase 20.5 closed those gaps**: the digital-delivery queue + order section and the full suppliers UI now exist, the missing Phase 19 endpoints (assignment resend / status / mark-invalid) were added, refund/cancel webhook safe-release was wired, and the `digital_delivery` RBAC names were aligned. See the Phase 20.5 section below.

---

## Phase 15 — Digital Product Foundation — ✅ COMPLETED

- **Files:** `apps/api/src/db/schema/digital-product-settings.ts`; `apps/api/src/modules/digital-products/*` (schemas/service/serializer/controller/routes + 2 tests); `apps/dashboard/src/components/products/DigitalSettingsCard.tsx`, `digital-settings-options.ts`, `DigitalFulfillmentSummary.tsx`; `apps/dashboard/src/lib/digital-products-api.ts`.
- **Migration:** `0012_lethal_onslaught.sql` — `digital_product_settings`, unique `(store_id, product_id)` + 3 indexes. Matches spec 4.2.
- **Endpoints:** `GET /products/:id/digital-settings` (`digital_inventory.view`), `PATCH /products/:id/digital-settings` (`digital_inventory.edit`). Full Zod validation (fulfillment type, delivery mode, pool strategy, status arrays, deliver⊆reserve, max_codes bounds, unknown-key/empty-body rejection, archived-product + tenant guards).
- **Frontend:** "إعدادات المنتج الرقمي" section on product edit page; "رقمي" badge on product **details** page; edit gated by `digital_inventory.edit`.
- **Tests:** `digital-products.schemas.test.ts` (incl. audit-metadata excludes template body), `digital-products.serializer.test.ts`.
- **Risky gaps:** (MEDIUM) "رقمي" badge required on the product **list** page is only on the details page — list query never exposes a digital flag. (LOW) No service-level cross-store/archived test.

## Phase 16 — Code Inventory & Secure Import — ✅ COMPLETED

- **Files:** `apps/api/src/db/schema/{code-batches,digital-codes}.ts`; `apps/api/src/lib/digital-code-crypto.ts` (+test); `apps/api/src/modules/digital-inventory/*` (controller/routes/import/parse/schemas/serializer/service + 4 tests); `apps/api/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts`; dashboard `pages/digital-inventory/{DigitalInventoryPage,DigitalBatchesPage}.tsx` + `components/digital-inventory/*` + `lib/digital-inventory-api.ts`.
- **Migration:** `0013_demonic_wolfsbane.sql` — `code_batches`, `digital_codes` (cipher/iv/tag/hash/preview, **no raw column**), unique `(store_id, product_id, code_hash)` + all spec indexes.
- **Endpoints:** `GET /digital-inventory/summary|codes|codes/:id|batches|batches/:id` (`digital_inventory.view`); `POST /import` (`digital_inventory.import`); `POST /codes/:id/reveal` (`digital_inventory.reveal`, **rate-limited**, audited); `PATCH /codes/:id/status` (`digital_inventory.edit`, reason required for destructive transitions).
- **Security verified:** list/summary serializers are allowlists — **never return decrypted code**; `decryptDigitalCode` is called only in `revealCode`; reveal is gated + Redis rate-limited + audited (preview only); import dedups by `code_hash` both in-file and in-DB plus `onConflictDoNothing` race guard; AES-256-GCM + keyed HMAC.
- **Tests:** crypto round-trip/tamper/missing-key; parse dedup + "no raw code in candidates"; schemas; serializer asserts no cipher/hash/raw code in DTO.
- **Risky gaps:** (MEDIUM) Boot-guard is graceful-degradation (runtime `ServiceUnavailable` if keys absent) rather than a hard prod boot-refusal as the spec wording suggests. (LOW) Env vars named `DIGITAL_CODE_*` vs plan's `DIGITAL_CODES_*` (internally consistent). (LOW) `digital_inventory.export`/`.delete` permissions exist with no endpoints yet (forward-provisioned).

## Phase 17 — Code Assignment & Reservation Engine — 🟡 PARTIAL (backend complete, frontend missing)

- **Files:** `apps/api/src/db/schema/code-assignments.ts`; `apps/api/src/modules/digital-delivery/digital-delivery.{engine,service,controller,routes,schemas,serializer}.ts`; webhook seam in `apps/api/src/modules/webhooks/webhooks.service.ts`.
- **Migration:** `0014_sharp_dragon_lord.sql` — `code_assignments` (`code_id` FK `ON DELETE restrict`), **partial unique index `(store_id, code_id) WHERE status in ('assigned','delivered')`** (the double-sell guard). Added `orders.digital_delivery_status|digital_delivery_required|digital_delivery_completed_at`. `order_items` columns **not** added — counts derived live (valid alternative permitted by spec).
- **Endpoints:** `POST /digital-delivery/orders/:orderId/assign` (`digital_delivery.assign`); `GET /digital-delivery/orders/:orderId/assignments` (`.view`); `GET /digital-delivery/queue` (`.view`).
- **Concurrency verified:** selection uses raw `... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` inside `db.transaction`, guarded `WHERE status='available'` flip + partial-unique index. All 4 pool strategies correct. Re-running assignment is idempotent (counts existing active assignments, never downgrades `completed`). Webhook `processOrderEvent` calls `maybeAssignCodesForOrder` (status-gated by `reserve_on_statuses`, try/catch isolated).
- **Tests:** `digital-delivery.engine.test.ts` (status derivation + audit metadata = ids/counts only), `digital-delivery.schemas.test.ts`. No live-DB concurrency integration test.
- **Risky gaps:** (HIGH) **Entire frontend missing** — no `/digital-delivery` queue page, no order-details digital fulfillment section, no `digital-delivery-api.ts` client. The manual-review notifications fire but there is no UI to act on them.

## Phase 18 — Automatic Digital Delivery — 🟡 PARTIAL (backend ~95%, frontend missing)

- **Files:** `apps/api/src/modules/digital-delivery/{delivery.service,delivery.channels,delivery.template,delivery.controller,delivery.schemas,delivery.serializer}.ts`; schema `digital-deliveries.ts`, `delivery-attempts.ts`; connector `plugins/wordpress-connector/includes/class-saas-connector-delivery.php` (+ rest/signature).
- **Migration:** `0015_unusual_khan.sql` — `digital_deliveries` (4.8), `delivery_attempts` (4.9). `message_preview`/`error_message` documented as masked-only.
- **Endpoints present:** `POST /orders/:orderId/deliver` (`digital_delivery.deliver`); `GET /orders/:orderId/deliveries`, `GET /deliveries/:id`, `GET /deliveries` (`.view`).
- **Security verified:** delivery idempotent (no-op when all delivered) and transactional (marks assignments+codes `delivered`, order `completed`); WooCommerce note is **count-only private staff note — no raw codes** passed to the channel; connector `digital-note` route is HMAC-signed (constant-time, replay-protected). Default Arabic template; template tests assert no raw code in output/logs.
- **Tests:** `delivery.audit`, `delivery.channels`, `delivery.serializer`, `delivery.template`.
- **Risky gaps:** (MEDIUM) Spec `POST /orders/:orderId/resend` implemented as `/retry` (perm `digital_delivery.retry`). (HIGH) Entire delivery frontend missing.

## Phase 19 — Manual Fulfillment, Resend & Replacement — 🟡 PARTIAL (backend ~70%, frontend missing)

- **Files:** `apps/api/src/modules/digital-delivery/{manual.service,manual.controller,manual.schemas,transitions}.ts`.
- **Endpoints present:** `POST /orders/:orderId/manual-assign` (`.assign`); `POST /assignments/:assignmentId/replace` (`.assign`); `POST /orders/:orderId/release` (cancel/refund/manual_release, `.retry`).
- **Endpoints MISSING vs spec:** `POST /assignments/:assignmentId/resend`; `PATCH /assignments/:assignmentId/status`; `POST /digital-inventory/codes/:id/mark-invalid` (generic Phase-16 `PATCH /codes/:id/status` partly substitutes); order-level `/resend`.
- **Data integrity verified:** `transitions.ts` `decideReleaseOutcome` + `CODE_TRANSITIONS` enforce **delivered/revealed codes never return to `available`**; only undelivered reserved codes can be released. Reason enforced at Zod boundary for manual-assign/replace/release.
- **Risky gaps:** (HIGH) **No webhook handling for `order.cancelled`/`order.refunded`** — safe release is manual-endpoint-only; an upstream Woo refund does not auto-trigger release (status guard still prevents accidental re-stocking, so it is a workflow gap, not a leak). (MEDIUM) Missing audit actions `digital_code_resent`, `digital_code_marked_invalid`, `digital_assignment_refunded`, `digital_assignment_cancelled` (release records a single `digital_code_released`). (HIGH) Entire support-actions frontend missing (no reveal/resend/replace/manual-assign/mark-invalid controls, no replacement dialog on the order page).

## Phase 20 — Suppliers & Batch Cost Tracking — 🟡 PARTIAL (backend complete, frontend missing)

- **Files:** `apps/api/src/db/schema/{suppliers,supplier-products}.ts`; `apps/api/src/modules/suppliers/*` (routes/controller/service/schemas/serializer + 2 tests). Dashboard has only `lib/suppliers-api.ts` (read-only `listSuppliers` slice for the inventory filter).
- **Migration:** `0016_worthless_lockjaw.sql` — `suppliers` (+extra `is_preferred`), `supplier_products` unique `(store_id, supplier_id, product_id)`. **Adds the deferred Phase-16 FKs:** `code_batches.supplier_id` and `digital_codes.supplier_id` → `suppliers.id ON DELETE set null`.
- **Endpoints:** all 10 present — CRUD `/suppliers`, `/suppliers/:id`; products mapping `GET|POST /suppliers/:id/products`, `PATCH|DELETE /suppliers/:id/products/:mappingId`; `GET /suppliers/:id/batches`. DELETE is **soft archive** (blocks while active batches exist). Perms `digital_suppliers.view|create|edit|delete`.
- **Metrics:** total/available/sold/delivered/invalid/voided/refunded counts, batches/products counts, `estimatedCost`, `invalidRate` — store-scoped. Import flow accepts `supplierId` + `costPerCode` + `currency` (validates supplier is active + in store). Audit actions all wired.
- **Tests:** `suppliers.schemas.test.ts`, `suppliers.serializer.test.ts` (+`computeInvalidRate`).
- **Risky gaps:** (HIGH) **Entire suppliers UI missing** — no `/suppliers` list/detail pages, no nav entry, no full CRUD api client. (MEDIUM) Plan's behavioral tests (archive-vs-delete, tenant isolation, store-scoped metrics, batch supplier assignment) have no integration coverage. (LOW) "Estimated revenue" supplier metric not implemented.

## Phase 21 — Digital Reports & Profit Analytics — 🟡 PARTIAL (already started ahead of this audit)

- Code exists (commit `749b1ee`): `apps/api/src/modules/digital-reports/*` (service/math/serializer/schemas/controller/routes + 3 tests) and `apps/dashboard/src/pages/digital-reports/DigitalReportsPage.tsx` (+ nav + route + api client). All 7 logical reports present (summary/inventory/sales/profit/suppliers/delivery/low-stock). Not deeply audited here.

---

## Cross-cutting findings

1. **RBAC divergence (`digital_delivery.*`).** Plan §3 specifies `.view/.assign/.resend/.replace/.refund`; code has `.view/.assign/.deliver/.retry`. There is **no distinct `.refund` or `.replace` permission** — replacement/refund are gated under `.assign`/`.retry`. Decide whether the plan's granular gating is required before Phase 24.
2. **Frontend routes: 3 of 9 planned exist.** Present: `/digital-inventory`, `/digital-inventory/batches`, `/digital-reports`. Missing: `/digital-inventory/batches/:id`, `/digital-inventory/codes/:id`, `/digital-delivery`, `/digital-delivery/orders/:orderId`, `/suppliers`, `/suppliers/:id`. Sidebar has only 2 digital entries (inventory, reports).
3. **No phase-status doc previously existed** — `docs/README.md` is a stub pointing at `plan.md`. This file (`docs/status.md`) and the updated table in `plan2.md §8` now track real status.

## Is it safe to start Phase 21?

- **Data dependencies:** YES — Phase 21 reports read assignments, deliveries, supplier costs, and code statuses, all of which the Phase 17–20 **backends** produce. Build and tests are green.
- **Reality check:** Phase 21 is **already implemented** (backend + frontend + tests), so "starting" it is largely moot.
- **Recommendation (now resolved by Phase 20.5):** the operator-facing gaps in 17–20 have been closed — see below.

## Phase 20.5 — Digital Operations UI & Support Gap Closure (✅ COMPLETED 2026-06-27)

A remediation phase (not in the original plan) that closes the 17–20 frontend gaps and the Phase 19 backend gaps surfaced by the audit. No Phase 22 work; no customer self-service.

### 1. Digital delivery frontend (Phases 17–19)
- `/digital-delivery` — manual review queue (`DigitalDeliveryQueuePage`): status filter + search + pagination, loading/empty/error/no-access states.
- `/digital-delivery/orders/:orderId` — standalone order delivery page (`DigitalDeliveryOrderPage`).
- Reusable `components/digital-delivery/OrderDigitalSection.tsx` — digital status, masked assignments table, delivery history, and the full action toolkit: assign / deliver / retry / manual-assign / release, plus per-code reveal (existing audited endpoint) / resend / replace / status-change / mark-invalid. **Embedded in the Phase-7 `OrderDetailsPage`** (gated by `digital_delivery.view`).
- Action dialogs: `ReplaceCodeDialog`, `ManualAssignDialog`, `AssignmentStatusDialog`, `MarkInvalidDialog`, `ReleaseDialog`; reused `RevealCodeDialog`.
- `lib/digital-delivery-api.ts` client. Codes are never shown in lists; full reveal stays on the dedicated audited endpoint.

### 2. Suppliers frontend (Phase 20)
- `/suppliers` (`SuppliersListPage`) — table, search + status filter, create, pagination, no-access state.
- `/suppliers/:id` (`SupplierDetailsPage`) — supplier data, performance metrics tiles, linked-products section (link/edit/unlink), code-batches section, edit + archive.
- Dialogs `SupplierFormDialog`, `SupplierProductDialog`; extended `lib/suppliers-api.ts` to full CRUD + details + products + batches + metrics.

### 3. Phase 19 backend gaps closed
- `POST /digital-delivery/assignments/:id/resend` (`digital_delivery.resend`) — re-delivers an assignment's code without creating a new assignment.
- `PATCH /digital-delivery/assignments/:id/status` (`digital_delivery.refund`) — cancel/refund/fail one assignment; delivered codes are locked as `refunded`, never returned to stock (pure, unit-tested `decideAssignmentStatusOutcome`).
- `POST /digital-inventory/codes/:id/mark-invalid` (`digital_inventory.edit`) — audited "supplier said it's bad" shortcut.
- New audit actions: `digital_code_resent`, `digital_code_marked_invalid`, `digital_assignment_refunded`, `digital_assignment_cancelled`.

### 4. Refund/cancel webhook safe-release
- `webhooks.service.ts` now calls `maybeReleaseCodesForOrder` when an order becomes `cancelled`/`refunded`. Best-effort (never throws), idempotent (skips terminal/empty orders), and **never returns delivered/revealed codes to stock** — only undelivered reserved codes are released. Recorded as a system audit entry.

### 5. RBAC alignment (no weakening)
- Added `digital_delivery.resend`, `.replace`, `.refund` (the plan §3 names). Granted resend+replace to Manager/Order-Employee/Customer-Support; refund to Manager (Owner = all). Replace route moved from `.assign` → `.replace` (every role that could replace before still can; Customer-Support gains it per plan §3.1). `digital_delivery.deliver`/`.retry` retained for backward compatibility. `reveal`/`export`/`delete` grants untouched.

### Navigation / routes
- Sidebar now has «تسليم الأكواد» (`digital_delivery.view`) and «الموردين» (`digital_suppliers.view`). Four new routes registered (lazy-loaded).

### Verification
- API: typecheck clean, **293/293 unit tests pass** (+5 for the new schemas/transition logic), lint clean.
- Dashboard: production build clean, lint clean (each new page ships its own chunk).
- **Not browser-tested:** the new pages sit behind auth and need PostgreSQL/Redis + a live API, which are unavailable here (same constraint as Phases 13–20); verified structurally.

### Remaining risks / follow-ups
- Order-level `POST /orders/:orderId/release` still uses `digital_delivery.retry` (unchanged to avoid weakening); the new granular per-assignment refund/cancel uses `digital_delivery.refund`. Reconcile if the plan wants a single gate.
- Assignment-level resend re-delivers the whole order's codes via the order-scoped engine (no single-code delivery path exists) — consistent with order-level retry; documented.
- New `digital_delivery.*` permissions require a `db:seed` run to materialize in an existing database before the new endpoints/nav are usable.
- The minor Phase 15 gap (digital badge on the product **list** page) remains out of scope for 20.5.
- No live WooCommerce/DB round-trip was exercised (no environment).
